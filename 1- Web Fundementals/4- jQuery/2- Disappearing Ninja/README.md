When a particular image is clicked, have that image disappear.&nbsp;Also, include a button on the bottom of the page called 'Restore'. When the button is clicked, all images will appear.</p><p>There is no need for you to keep the images appearing where they used to appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, clicking on the 7th image does not need to show an empty spot where the 7th image used to be.&nbsp; The 8th image could instead move to where 7th image used to be.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Don't spend more than 3 hours trying to get this to work.</em></p>
