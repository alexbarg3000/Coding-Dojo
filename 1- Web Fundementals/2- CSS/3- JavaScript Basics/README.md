 <strong>Before you submit your work:</strong></p><ul>
 <li>Remember that you're here to learn: Don't try to find the original source code of these images.</li> <li>Make sure you've validated your HTML.</li> <li><strong>Also, do NOT make this responsive. Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 970px).</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have time during the bootcamp, go through our responsive design course <em>later</em>, but,&nbsp;for now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first. &nbsp;The responsive design course is added at the end of the Web Fundamentals track, and you can do this later in your bootcamp.</li></ul><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3921/handouts/chapter3921_7215_jsloups.png"></p>
