<h1>About Python</h1>
<p>Break down the image below into proper HTML and CSS. Feel free to download the assignment here:&nbsp;<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3921/handouts/chapter3921_7093_python-BSD.png" target="_blank">Python</a></p>
<p>Before you submit your work:</p>
<ul>
 
<li>Remember that you're here to learn: Don't try to find the original source code of these images.</li> 
<li>Use&nbsp;<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3921/handouts/chapter3921_7095_python.png" target="_blank">images here</a> for this exercise.</li> 
<li>Make sure you've validated your HTML and that you're not using any float: left or right.</li> 
<li>For the "&gt;&gt;" on the list, don't worry about making it look exactly like &gt;&gt;.&nbsp;You can just use a normal circle for this assignment.</li> 
<li><strong>Do NOT make this responsive. &nbsp;Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 970px).</strong>&nbsp; You will go through our responsive design course later. For now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first.</li></ul>
