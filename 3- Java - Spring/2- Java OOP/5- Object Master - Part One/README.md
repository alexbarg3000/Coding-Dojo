<p>A local D&amp;D club has asked you to help them by creating the objects they might use with a simple Java program to track their players. To start, they would like to have only Humans in this particular campaign. The humans can all select various classes (<code>Wizard</code>, <code>Ninja</code>, <code>Samurai</code>).</p>
<p>They say that the humans should all have four properties: strength, intelligence, stealth, and health. The starting value for each of the properties should be 3, except for health - that should be 100. Each human should also have the ability to attack, where they decrease the health of whatever they attacked by their strength.</p>
<p>They want to see if you can make a class that they could use before anything further, so just implement the <code>human</code> class.</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<p>● Implement packages to namespace your project.</p>
<p>● Implement inheritance.<br></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks:</h3>
<p>● Create a <code>Human</code> class</p>
<p>● Add the <code>strength</code>, <code>stealth</code>, and <code>intelligence</code> attributes with a default of 3</p>
<p>● Add the <code>health</code> attribute with a default of 100</p>
<p>● Add the <code>attack(Human)</code> method that reduces the health of the attacked human by the strength of the current human.</p>
<p>● Test these methods work using a <code>HumanTest</code> class</p>
