<h1 id="zoo-keeper-part-two">Zoo Keeper: Part Two</h1>
<p>The zoo keeper was happy with the work you did and now wants some more help, they have captured a rare specimen. Its default energy is much higher than most mammals, its energy level is 300. It also can do a lot more than climb - it can fly. Moreover, this specimen doesn't eat bananas, it eats humans... and it doesn't throw things, but attacks towns. The zoo keeper has caught a giant Bat and wants your help to track its energy levels.</p>
<p>The bat should be tested by attacking three towns, eating two humans, flying twice, and then displaying its energy. Use the display energy from the superclass!</p>

<p>● Create a <code>Bat</code>&nbsp;class that&nbsp;can <code>fly()</code>, <code>eatHumans()</code>, and <code>attackTown()</code> and has a default energy level of 300.</p>
<p>● For the <code>fly()</code> method, print the sound a bat taking off and decrease its energy by 50.</p>
<p>● For the <code>eatHumans()</code> method, print the so- well, never mind, just increase its energy by 25.</p>
<p>● For the <code>attackTown()</code> method, print the sound of a town on fire and decrease its energy by 100.</p>
<p>● Create a <font color="#c7254e" face="Consolas, Menlo, Monaco, Courier New, monospace">BatTest</font>&nbsp;class to instantiate a bat and have it attack three towns, eat two humans, and fly twice.</p>
