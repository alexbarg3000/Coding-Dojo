The first person in the DB has a license number of 000001. Increment by 1 every time a new person is added.</p><p>● Have a person's show page that will retrieve their name, license number, license state, and license expiration date</p><h2 id="war-file">.war File</h2><p>To test if you have completed this assignment correctly, we have created a project that simply displays all the people in your database with their license information.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/war.png" alt="warproject"></p><p>First download this .war file: <a href="https://github.com/itzedu/warFiles/raw/master/license-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war" target="_blank">license-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war</a>. Now, you can run <code>java -jar license-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war</code> and it will start this Spring Boot project on port 3000. Visit localhost:3000 and you should see the picture above but with the information of your database. If not, you have added people and licenses incorrectly. <strong>Make sure that your schema in your MySQL database is called 'relationships'</strong>.</p>
