<p>You've been asked by Lookify to help rewrite their playlist web app. Right now, it's tied up to their online store, and they want to demo something a little more lightweight. They just want you to be able to add songs to the list with:</p>
<p>● a title (it has to be at least 5 characters)</p>
<p>● an artist (it must be at least 5 characters)</p>
<p>● a rating (it must be a number between 1 and 10)</p>
<p>Aside from having the list, they also want you to be able to search the list by the artist. If the user enters incorrect information, the app must also tell them why. The description should only show when the item has been clicked on. Users should also be able to delete their items.</p>
