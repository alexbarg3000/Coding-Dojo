Your query should return the name of the country and the total number of cities.

The query should display the name of the region and the number of countries. Also, the query should arrange the result by the number of countries in descending order.</p></li></ol><h3 id="set-up">Set Up</h3><p>First, create a brand new Spring Boot project named countries. In this project, you will have one controller with one handler method annotated with <code>@RequestMapping('/')</code>, and one service called the ApiService. This service will have all the repository dependencies that you need. It is your job to create the repositories and the domain models. For each query, all you need to change is the service method (which will fire the query) that the handler calls upon a get request for the root route. Below is a table for you to use as a reference.</p><table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr class="header"><th>MySql Type</th><th>Java Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Char</td><td>String</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>VARCHAR</td><td>String</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>LONGVARCHAR</td><td>String</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>NUMERIC</td><td>java.math.BigDecimal</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>DECIMAL</td><td>java.math.BigDecimal</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>BIT</td><td>boolean</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>TINYBIT</td><td>byte</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>SMALLINT</td><td>short</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>INTEGER</td><td>int</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>BIGINT</td><td>long</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>REAL</td><td>float</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>FLOAT</td><td>double</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>DOUBLE</td><td>double</td></tr></tbody></table>
